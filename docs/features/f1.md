i want to build a kcl package that generates multiple provider from some kind config file. right now i see it hardcoded. seperate to   
reused code in other kcl files. create configs for examples: rust single app, tanstack app, tauri app, any other fe app, be with any   
language. the configs manages the provider part and more core configurations. maybe we can hold a list of well tested ci flows that    
can provide to users to choose when they do the onboarding part of the of idp adding repository. we need first kcl for github in       
crossplane, see if platform folder can handle it.
