//! Application state management.
//!
//! This module defines the shared application state passed to all request handlers.
//! The state contains:
//! - Configuration
//! - gRPC client connections
//! - Database connections (PostgreSQL, Redis)
//! - Notification service (NATS-based email queueing)
//! - Vector service (Qdrant-backed)

/// - Notification service for email queueing via NATS
